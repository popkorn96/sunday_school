# Specifications for the Rails Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
  ~~ initialized this app with 'gem installl rails' then 'rails new sunday_school', then initiated repo within root directory

  ~~ Rails offers two different ways to declare a many-to-many relationship between models. I offer the relationship between Assignments and Children which display the simpler form of declaring a many-to-many relationship using the has_many_and_belongs_to association, join table labeled children_assignments
- [ ] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
  ~~ **Assignment is being considered for this role
- [ ] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)
